I'm already half way through the course. I've been studying every day for the last week and has been a good experience so far.
These courses keep me very motivated, more than college lol.
The first half was mainly about series, dataframes and plotting data to different kinds of graphs.
I learned to use a couple different python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Cufflinks.
All very powerful and useful for this kind of work. The course uses Jupyter notebooks for each chapter and for exercises which
comes very handy to use as a reference for future projects.

Here are exaples of graphs, this one is made with seaborn:
