I'm already half way through the course. I've been studying every day for the last week and has been a good experience so far.
These courses keep me very motivated, more than college lol.
The first half was mainly about series, dataframes and plotting data to different kinds of graphs.
I learned to use a couple different python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Cufflinks.
All very powerful and useful for this kind of work. The course uses Jupyter notebooks for each chapter and for exercises which
comes very handy to use as a reference for future projects.

Here are exaples of graphs, this one is made with seaborn:

It shows the ammount of 911 calls on every hour of the day on each day. You can see there are less calls during the night and during Sundays and Saturdays. Pretty cool.
