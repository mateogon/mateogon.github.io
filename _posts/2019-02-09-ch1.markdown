First chapter of the course was a Python crash course. I already knew most except for lambda expressions and map().
So to use map function you need to do the following:
{% highlight python %}
data = [1,2,3,4]
list = list(map(square,data))
{% endhighlight %}

And for lambdas, if you for example have the following function:
{% highlight python %}
def square(n)
  return n**2
#=> returns the square of n.
{% endhighlight %}

You can make a lambda expression of that function, it would look like:

{% highlight python %}
lambda n: n**2
{% endhighlight %}

And then you can replace the map function, so you don't have to define a function for it:
{% highlight python %}
data = [1,2,3,4]
list = list(map(lambda n: n**2,data))
{% endhighlight %}
